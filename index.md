Welcome to Code Mentoring!

This is a group for all levels of coders who want to improve their skills. Whether you've never written a line of code in your life, or you're a seasoned code-monkey, this group is for you! 

We meet up regularly and provide an easy environment to learn how to code, improve your skills, or if you feel you're good enough, help out with mentoring.

Join us on [Slack](https://tiny.cc/codement) and check out our [learning resources](learn.md).
