# Resources and Learning Path

Many websites provide well structured learning paths and tutorials
which give you all of the educational resources needed to become a Software Engineer.

Here's our recommended resources and learning path, which is all available online for free.

---

## Step One

Follow these learning paths on FreeCodeCamp in this order:
1. [Basic HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)  
1. [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/)
1. [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/)

Take your time and play around with each new thing that you learn.

---

## Step Two
Computer Science fundamentals.
  
  * [Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) from HavardX.

---

## Step Three

Well done! You've advanced beyond the beginning stages.
Now it's time to deepen your knowledge of Web Development.

* [Advanced JavaScript (ES6)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#es6)  
* [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects)  

<details>
  <summary>Frontend</summary>
 
* [Responsive Web Design Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-projects)  
* [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
* [Frontend Developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Backend & full-stack</summary>
  
* [Full-stack course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) (React, Node.js, MongoDB)
* [Backend Developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend)  
</details>

## Step Four

Now you have solid knowledge and technical skill, but to get into the industry
you must understand how software is developed and how to crack the coding interview.

Our Code Mentoring [meetups](meetup.markdown) and [learning projects](projects.markdown) will help you to get there.

## Additional Resources 

When you're comfortable in the technology stack that you're working with,
it's good to expand your knowledge of other areas from time to time.
