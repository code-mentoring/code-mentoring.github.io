# Resources and Learning Path

Many websites provide well structured learning paths and tutorials
which give you all of the educational resources needed to become a Software Engineer.

Here's our recommended resources and learning path, which is all available online for free.

---

## Step One

Learn the fundamentals of coding (i.e. programming) with the popular JavaScript language.

  * [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/)

Take your time and play around with each tutorial.

---

## Step Two
If you've enjoyed solving problems with code and figuring things out, then continue the journey with a solid foundation in Computer Science.
  
  * [Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) from HavardX.

## Step Three

Well done! You've advanced beyond the beginning stages.
Now it's time to deepen your knowledge of Web Development.

## Step Four

Now you have solid knowledge and technical skill, but to get into the industry
you must understand how software is developed and how to crack the coding interview.

Our Code Mentoring [meetups](meetup.markdown) and [learning projects](projects.markdown) will help you to get there.
