# Resources and Learning Path

Many websites provide well structured learning paths and tutorials
which give you all of the educational resources needed to become a Software Engineer.

Here's our recommended resources and learning path, which is all available online for free.

---

## Step One

Learn the fundamentals of coding (i.e. programming) with the popular JavaScript language.

  * [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/)

Take your time and play around with each tutorial.

---

## Step Two
If you've enjoyed solving problems with code and figuring things out, then continue the journey with a solid foundation in Computer Science.
  
  * [Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) from HavardX.

## Step Three

Well done! You've advanced beyond the beginning stages.
Now it's time to deepen your knowledge of Web Development.

## Step Four

Now you have solid knowledge and technical skill, but to get into the industry
you must understand how software is developed and how to crack the coding interview.

* See [How to effectively use LeetCode to prepare for interviews](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/449135/How-to-effectively-use-LeetCode-to-prepare-for-interviews).
  * Come join our coding club meet-ups to practice.
* Contribute to open source projects to learn how software development is done.
  * Join our _#jitsi-project_ Slack channel and get involved with Jitsi Meet.
  * See [how to contribute to Jitsi Meet as a Developer](https://community.jitsi.org/t/how-to-how-to-contribute-to-jitsi-meet-as-a-developer/113009).
