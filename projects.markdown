- Regular meetup event to discuss specific solutions to <a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank">Crack the Coding Interview</a> questions.
- See our <a href="https://github.com/code-mentoring/ctci" target="_blank">CTCI GitHub repo</a> for more details.
  
### Open Source Project (Jitsi)

- Contributing to open source is a great way to learn how software applications are developed, and to gain experience
as a developer writing code that will be used by people all over the world.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) is our preferred video conferencing platform for hosting online meetup events,
which also happens to be open source and free to use.
- We will explore the Jisti Meet code (built on React and React Native), learn about the software development lifecycle
and contribute as best we can to this open source project.
- Regular meetup events and Slack channel (#jitsi) for discussion and collaboration.
