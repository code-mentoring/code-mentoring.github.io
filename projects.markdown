### Open Source Project (Jitsi)

- Contributing to open source is a great way to learn how software applications are developed, and to gain experience
as a developer writing code that will be used by people all over the world.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) is our preferred video conferencing platform for hosting online meetup events,
which also happens to be open source and free to use.
- We will explore the Jisti Meet code base (built on React and React Native), learn about the software development lifecycle
and contribute as best we can to this open source project.
- Regular meetup events and Slack channel (#jitsi) for discussion and collaboration.
