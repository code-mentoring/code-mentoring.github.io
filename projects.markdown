These are our ongoing projects and you're very welcome to join us.

### Coding Club

- This is a place for coders of all levels to practice their data structures and algorithms skills. 
- Whether you simply can't get enough data structures and algorithms problems, or you're actively looking for your first software engineering job and pretty nervous about "the coding part" of the interview.
- We get together to discuss coding problems and our solutions, the likes of which could get asked on an interview.
- Join one of our meetups to get involved.
  
### Open Source Project (Jitsi)

* Contributing to open source is a great way to learn how software applications are developed, and to gain experience as a developer writing code that will be used by people all over the world.
* This group focuses on the open source Jitsi Meet video conferencing solution which is built on React (web) and React Native (mobile).
* We contribute to the project in our own time, and help each other by collaborating and sharing knowledge.
* See our [FAQ page](faq.markdown) for more info about how you can get involved.
