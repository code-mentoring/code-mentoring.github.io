These are our ongoing projects and you're very welcome to join us.

### Data Structures and Algorithms Club

- This is a place for coders of all levels to practice their data structures and algorithms skills. 
- Whether you simply can't get enough data structures and algorithms problems, or you're actively looking for your first software engineering job and pretty nervous about "the coding part" of the interview.
- Every 2 weeks we get together to discuss a particularly tickling problem, the likes of which could get asked on an interview.
  
### Open Source Project (Jitsi)

- Contributing to open source is a great way to learn how software applications are developed, and to gain experience
as a developer writing code that will be used by people all over the world.
- [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) is our preferred video conferencing platform for hosting online meetup events,
which also happens to be open source and free to use.
- This is a place for us to learn about the Jitsi web/mobile application used by people all over the world, contribute as best we can to the code and help each other as we go.
- Good knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required. If you're totally new to web development, then see our recommended resources and learning path at [Resources](resources.markdown).
