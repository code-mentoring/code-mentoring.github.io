We are an international community of budding and seasoned software developers creating opportunities for companionship and growth through meetups in the technology space.

We are open to all experience levels. Anybody who wants to improve their skills and help others is welcome to join our knowledge sharing meetups and collaborate on projects.

Our meetups are free and organised by volunteers. Everyone has their struggles and difficulties, but together we can get through them and improve our skills along the way.
