We are an international community of budding and seasoned software developers creating opportunities for companionship and growth through meetups in the technology space.

All of the educational resources that you need are available online for free, or in books.
See our recommended resources and learning path to become a software developer at [Resources](resources.markdown).

We are open to all experience levels. Anybody who wants to improve their skills and help others is welcome to join our free mentoring meetups and collaborate in our [Projects](projects.markdown).

Our meetups are free and organised by volunteers. 
Everyone has their struggles and difficulties, but together we can get through them and improve our skills along the way.
