We are an international community of budding and seasoned Software Engineers creating opportunities for companionship and growth through free knowledge sharing meetups and learning projects.

We are open to all experience levels. Anybody who wants to improve their skills and help others is welcome to join our [Meetups](meetup.markdown) and collaborate in our [Projects](projects.markdown).

Everyone has their struggles and difficulties, but together we can get through them and improve our skills along the way.
