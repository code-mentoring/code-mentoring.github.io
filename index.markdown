Welcome to Code Mentoring!

This is a group for all levels of coders who work on the web. Whether you've never written a line of code in your life, or you're a seasoned code-monkey, this group is for you! We meet up regularly and provide an easy environment to learn how to code, improve your skills, or if you feel you're good enough, help out with mentoring.

We love to host meetups to share tips and advice, and create instructional web development tutorials for you.

Anyone who wants to improve themselves and help others is welcome to join.

If you need some direction with your learning, then see our recommended [Resources and Learning Path](resources.markdown).
